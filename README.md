Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis project. The project aims to provide key insights into the Airbnb market by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of listings.

Project Description
The global rise of Airbnb has created a complex and competitive market for hosts. This project addresses the need for data-driven insights by analyzing an extensive Airbnb dataset. The primary goal is to uncover booking dynamics, pricing trends, and user preferences to help hosts optimize their strategies and to provide Airbnb with valuable information to enhance user experience. The analysis focuses on understanding factors that influence listing popularity, price, and host performance.

Problem Statement
The project seeks to answer critical questions for both hosts and the Airbnb platform, including:

How are listing prices distributed across different neighborhoods and room types?

What factors (e.g., location, room type, construction year, host verification) most significantly impact a listing's number of reviews and availability?

How do cancellation policies affect booking behavior?

Who Are the End-Users?
The insights generated from this analysis are primarily for:

Airbnb Hosts: To help them set competitive prices, choose optimal property locations, and understand which amenities or policies attract more guests.

Airbnb Corporate Team: To understand market trends, identify popular areas, and improve the platform's features for both hosts and guests.
